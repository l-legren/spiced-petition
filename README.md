# spiced-petition
An online petition made with Express and Handlebars

## **Code in leret branch**

## What's this?

This project was built during my attendance to the Spiced Academy's Web Development Bootcamp in Berlin.

This is an online petition made with Node/Express and Handlebars. Users can sign up, sign in, draw a signature on a canvas, edit their profile, see other Users signature and filtering them by city.

## Why this?

I found building this App very useful as my very first component-based project to get used and comfortable working with components and passing props between parent and children. It was also very useful to learn the concept of mounting within a component.

## Technologies I used

- HTML5, CSS3
- Handlebars
- Node/Express
- PSQL

## Set Up

Clone it in your local directory in the terminal run it with `node .`. You will need to create a secrets.json for cookieSession's keys.
